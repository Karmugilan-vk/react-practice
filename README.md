 ðŸš€ React Practice Journey  

Welcome to my **React learning path repository**!  
Here I build small, reusable components to practice and understand the **core concepts of React**.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Concepts Covered
- âœ… JSX Basics  
- âœ… Components & Props  
- âœ… Object Destructuring  
- âœ… Event Handling  
- âœ… Lists & Keys  
- âœ… Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)  
- âœ… Component Lifecycle Basics  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Practice writing **clean, structured React code**  
- Understand **reusability** of components  
- Build **step by step** instead of copy-paste learning  
- Get comfortable with **real project workflow**

The purpose of this repo is to gradually build a solid foundation in React development and prepare for real-world projects.
